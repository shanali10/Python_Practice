#simple strings

a = 5;
b = 34;
c = "shan"
d = 'S'

e = "Hello from %d %d %s %c" %(a,b,c,d)
print(e)

# // f String...

print(f"The is {a}, {c}, {b} and {d}... I hope you enjoy it")


# printing with simple print function same variables..... let's see.....

print("This is", a, c, b, "and ", d, "I hope you enjoy it")


# f string is 200% better than normal string .......
